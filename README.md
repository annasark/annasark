### Hi there, I'm Anna ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent CS graduate from California State University of Sacramento, who is passionate about pursuing a career in software development. 
I am dedicated to honing my craft and that includes picking up many side projects to help work towards my own developmental goals. 

During my 6 month software engineering intern at Northern California Power Agency, I worked to develop a new version of a 25 year old legacy application 
that addressed previous shortcomings and wants by business end-users. While developing this project, I excelled in developing client-side applications using Angular and Infragistics UI Library by designing functional web layouts, implementing reactive forms, and strategically building singleton services. I also contributed significantly to backend development and implementing APIs in ASP.NET. I utilized tools like Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach to defining tables in MySQL, implementing EF Fluent API for Oracle support, and unit testing to ensure API controllers perform as designed. My role also involved analyzing legacy schemas, aiding in new schema design, extracting test data, and identifying issues related to data migration. 

My latest completed project is my senior project which at its core is a shop management site for our client who needed a way to schedule appointments from customers, respond to custom product requests, upload new products into the site, and manage their business and personal calendar into one. Based on the Next.js framework, I directly developed the functionality for the client to manage pending requests and appointments through the admin dashboard, and replicated similar functionalities onto the user dashboards concerning appointments and requests made by users on their accounts. This allowed for the clientâ€™s appointment system and custom product requests to be managed in the same place and offered ease in organization as the application directly organized requests and appointments for the client. This project was designed using Figma and implemented user-friendly UI components using the Material UI Library. Additionally, I developed APIs to manage client-side actions, such as appointment confirmation/rejection, asynchronous data retrieval, and integration of email services.
